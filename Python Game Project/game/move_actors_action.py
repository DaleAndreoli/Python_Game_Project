#
# Description:
#   The game loop event that updates each actor.
#   Establishes the execute method that is specific to this event.
#
# OOP Principles Used:
#   Polymorphism
#
# Reasoning:
#   Polymorphism is used by this event as it inherits from Action, but changes
#       the .execute() method to perform its specific action.
#
