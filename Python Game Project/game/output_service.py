# Description:
#   Used to interface with the asciimatics library to draw outputs to the screen..
#
# OOP Principles Used:
#   Abstraction
#
# Reasoning:
#   Abstraction is used to handle output within this class so that other 
#       files do not need to worry about what is happening under the hood here.
