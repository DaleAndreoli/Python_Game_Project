#
# Description:
#   This class cues the different game loop events and executes them in order.
#
# OOP Principles Used:
#   Polymorphism
#
# Reasoning:
#   Polymorphism is used by each game loop event as they all inherit the .execute() method.
#       Each event has a unique .execute() method, but polymorphism allows them to be 
#       called in a loop in cue_action()
#
